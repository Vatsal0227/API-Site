API-Site

There were 2 different sites hostes: API Site and External Site

API Site - This was the first site hosted on AWS where I had all the databases and tables infomation on phpMyAdmin, and also all the files that are inside the **API_Files** folder. Primary language used for coding was Php. 

External Site - This was the second site hosted on AWS where I had the whole User Interface made for the users, it is also where all the files from the **External_Site_Files** folder were located. Primary language used for coding was Php.

Since my free trial was expiring on AWS both the sites are shut down.
